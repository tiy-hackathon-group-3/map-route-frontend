## Welcome to My Angular Project

This project utilizes the the following Angular Directives:

- Our Map is awesomely provided by Leaflet and Mapbox
- Angular-Routes
- Cookies.js

Please be sure to run `bower install` and `npm install` to be sure that all dependecies are installed into the project.


## Usage

This template contains some simple `gulp` tasks. They are as follows:


- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task
- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while

There are many more tasks, and you really should read through the `gulpfile.js`, but the ones above will take care of you in most cases.
